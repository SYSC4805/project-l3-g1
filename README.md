# Unmellow Yellow Autonomous Snowplow Robot

## Description
The **Unmellow Yellow Autonomous Snowplow Robot** is designed to autonomously clear snow in a designated area, avoiding obstacles like boxes and other robots. The robot uses **skid steering** with 4 motors, enabling it to navigate around obstacles and follow a predetermined path marked by a black perimeter. Equipped with multiple sensors, including IR, ultrasonic, and IMU, the robot detects its surroundings and makes real-time decisions to clear the area efficiently.

The goal of this project is to automate snow clearing, offering a solution that reduces manual labor and enhances efficiency, safety, and productivity for property owners and municipalities.
